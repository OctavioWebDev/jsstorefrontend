                    For over 10 years Jacob’s Supply has been scouring the area for the best deals on building products so they can make them available to their customers at extremely low prices.

                    It all started when Jacob’s father, Thad Armentrout, who was a general contractor, came across a large amount of brand new molding at a fraction of the original price. Other contractors got word and contacted Thad to purchase it. Realizing a need, Thad started looking for these deals across the state to pass along to other contractors. Thad slowly started to incorporate the reselling of materials into the business, which at the time was called Armentrout Construction.

                    In 2009 Thad passed away suddenly and his son Jacob took over the company. At that time Jacob was only 16 years old and did not have a general contractors license to build homes, so he did remodeling jobs as well as the buying and selling of building materials, as his father had started doing. During this time it was evident of the Lord’s love towards Jacob and his family as Jesus Christ providentially provided for the family, at many times and through many miracles. Due to the recession at that time, Jacob realized that more people were remodeling their own homes and were looking to save money wherever they could on their projects. He saw an increase in demand for discounted building materials. Over time, Jacob stopped the remodeling side of the business and focused solely on reselling building materials, as this is where God was guiding him and preparing this path for him.

                    Over the past few years, solely by the powerful working of Jesus Christ, Jacob has done some major changes to build this into a full-fledged store. God took someone who was young and prideful, who lacked in wisdom and experience, and rather simple, and did awesome things through him. Jacob cannot take the credit for what God did. This is to the glory of the one true God, the Lord Jesus Christ.

                    Today, the items are no longer left over products from jobs or local dealers, but new closeout and overstock items that Jacob’s Supply receives by the semi load direct from building manufacturers and dealers across the country. They purchase their product for significantly less than Jacob’s competitors purchase it for, thus enabling them to sell it close to half off what their competitors sell it for. Often they are selling their products below what their competitors buy it for, thus eliminating most all competition.

                    Jacob Armentrout: 100% equity owner and President. Jacob Armentrout has been owner and president of Jacob’s Supply, formerly Armentrout Construction, since his father passed away in 2009. Jacob was blessed to be raised by two Godly parents who feared and honored the Lord. After his father’s death, Jacob stepped up into the father role and became the breadwinner for his mom and siblings. It was only through the grace of God that Jacob could do this, by faith in God’s control, not faith in his own power; or rather, lack thereof. He has taken the company to new levels adapting the company to the ever changing climate of retail. He has built a reputation with his suppliers, customers and business partners, as an organized, biblical and exceptional business Christian. Through the adversity of being young and having just lost his father, God strengthened Jacob, and gave him perseverance which has guided Jacob’s Supply from a small company working mostly with local contractors, to a regional company working with contractors and homeowners alike. He has grown the business from a $50,000 a year company to a multi-million dollar a year company. The staff has also grown from a staff of just one, to a team of multiple people, each with their own unique talent.
